          During this series we will cover the basics of creating an Isometric
          game using C++. As this series is meant to cover the design aspects of
          creating an Isometric game we will be using a premade graphics engine.
          The series will be split into multiple segments, at the end of each
          segment you, if you have followed along during the tutorial, then at
          the end of each segment you will have a runnable program. There will
          be uploaded versions of my compiled executable if you just want to see
          what it looks like on your own machine.
